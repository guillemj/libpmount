libpmount - Portable mount library

This library implements functions pmount() and pumount() as wrappers to
the real mount/unmount unportable interfaces on each platform.

Its goal is to provide a consistent interface application programmers can
rely on for mounting and umounting filesystems without having to address
kernel-related portability problems.
